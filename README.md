> Twitter theme to increase your productivity as per changes in July 2019.

Made some changes to this amazing extension so that you can use it in 'Lights Out' mode and with blue color.
Added the Trending section for those who find it important (me :/).
Also, verification sign is back (LOL).
Some other minor changes to suit the needs. 

This version of twitter is very hard to override, so this extension is opinionated.

This isnt't available on chrome store so feel free to download and add it.
You can find link to Sarah's version on the chrome store in her repo.

If you want any changes to be made, do let me know. ðŸ˜‰
